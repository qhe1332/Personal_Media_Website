                This illustration was created by exploring the Precepts of Asymmetrical Balance. 
                I used a larger complex orange triangle as the base of the carrot and balanced it off with two smaller dark green shapes as the leaves. 
                A larger complex shape is heavier than smaller simple shapes. So I used a darker green on the smaller leaves to balance it.
