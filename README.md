# Personal_Media_Website
## 2020 Fall Media Final Project Proposal
### Page Name : Qian Yi's Page
A personal webpage created for my media class to display my artworks created through Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. I took all the photos and created all the images except for the photos manipulated in the Photo Montage page. Each page is labeled with the techniques I used on the photos or images. The end also includes a small interactive story called Wake Piggie Up.

### Interactive Story:
   - A short story to wake up our main character, Piggie, and make sure he catches the school bus and arrive to school safely.
        - Piggie's character design is based on one of my stuff animal and my little sibling ^^
   - All images are drawn my mouse on Adobe Illustrator
   - Implemented with the <map> tag/function in HTML

### Difficulties:
  - Drawing all the illustrations with a mouse on Adobe Illustrator.
  - Coming up with the interactive story.
