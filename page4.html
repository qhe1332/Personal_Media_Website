                This photo was taken with the idea of center of interest, where the yogurt bowl is the center of interest. 
                Then the pattern in the background is used to let the plain yogurt bowl pop out in the picture. 
                The contrast between red and green also draws the audience's attention towards the Strawberries first.
                I chose this photo because I like the color scheme of this photo.
